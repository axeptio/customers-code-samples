So far, here's what you can find in this repository:

## fetch-organization-aggregated-consents-registry
Running this script, you will get a CSV file containing all consents for all projects of a given organization.
It's pretty much the same as going to each of this organization's projects and downloading consents from the Consents Registry.
Except it saves you lots of clicks, and consents are aggregated into a single CSV file, with an extra column, `projectId`.
